# Assignment 2

You need to solve the following two problems in a programming language of your
choice.

1. My free cell problem
2. Parking lot problem

## Requirements

For each problem, you need to define:
    - State
    - Initial State
    - Goal Test
    - Successor Function
    - 2 Heuristic Functions

For each of the problems you must write an A* algorithm that uses the problem
definition and tries to solve the problem.  For each problem, I want you to
define two admissible non-trivial heuristics, one simple one, and another one
that dominates the first one.

## Submission

For each problem, you must turn in the following:
    - Your code.
    - An English description of state, initial state, goal test, successor function
       and 2 heuristics.
    - Program output of the solutions to the test problems below.  For each problem
       there will be two outputs, one for each heuristic.  The output should show
       the solution to the problem, the path cost of the solution, and the number of
       nodes that A* expanded.
