# Assignment 1

You need to solve the following two problems in a programming language of your
choice:

1. Geography Problem
2. PCP Problem

## Requirements

For each problem, you need to define:
    - State
    - Initial State
    - Goal Test
    - Successor Function

For each of the problems you must write a BFS algorithm and a DFS algorithm that
uses the problem definition and tries to solve the problem. Recall that
completeness issues, time complexity and space complexity may prevent your
program from solving the problem.

## Submission

For each problem, you must turn in the following:
    - Your code
    - An English description of state, initial state, goal test and successor
      function
    - Program output of the solutions to the test problems below
    - Output from your program indicating what order the nodes are visited for
      my test cases

**Note**: For the fourth part you must print out the states as they are visited.
